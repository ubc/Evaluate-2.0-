# Evaluate 2.0+
A major rewrite of the Evaluate plugin. No attempt made at backwards compatibility.

## Why create this rewrite?
The previous version of Evaluate was effective and functional, but only in narrow usage scenarios. When attempting to adapt it for other use cases, the plugin would break down. The administrative UI was also at time clunky.

This rewrite will create a more versatile plugin that can be hooked into and used by other plugins with ease.
